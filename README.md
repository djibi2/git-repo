Repo is a tool that built on top of Git. Repo helps us manage the many Git repositories, does the uploads to the revision control system, and automates parts of the Android development workflow. Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The repo command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.
